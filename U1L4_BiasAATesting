You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

-- The bathing suit company during the winter times - i.e. February - might show little favoritism or logical data knowing that most people won't be looking to purchase bathing suits. Therefore, emails sent during this time is most likely unfavorable to the company's marketing campaign. However for bathing suit purchases in May, right before summer, might show more favoritism within the consumer base to be more likely in purchasing bathing suits. The assumptions of the consumer's mindset right before certain seasons might show a certain bias that might tamper with the marketing campaign.

You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

-- The bias here shows that people who treat counseling for anxiety experience more anxiety so it is apparent to realize that within this demographic anxiety levels are higher. The bias is shifted in the demographic of people who visit the clinic to treat anxiety will always be higher than the general population.

You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

-- The bias here is that because the billboard was introduced, there was an event that caused an increase in website traffic within the first week. Naturally with so much exposure, you are going to get an increase in web traffic. There might be a bias to a certain demographic of drivers who see that ad in that area but also you may see ads tail off near the end as people may dismiss or just get used to it on their commutes.

You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

-- The loyalty program may not have any real incentive for people to latch onto within the first week, possibly due to lack of marketing. The loyalty program may also not see real effects until later when users become familiar with the program and are able to see what it is. There might be bias itself that the site might not generate enough user interest so a loyalty program may not be necessarily viable in this sense.
